# Circleguard
This project ultimately aims to create a comprehensive, player-run cheat detection tool. A by no means complete list of cheats includes replay stealing, relax, replay editing, and timewarp.

Disclaimer: Neither the Circleguard organization nor any of the circleguard devs are associated with osu! or the official osu! staff in any way.
