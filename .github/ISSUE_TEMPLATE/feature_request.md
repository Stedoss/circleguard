Please describe the new feature in as much detail as necessary. If you would like more base functionality (like detecting a different type of cheat), open this issue at [circlecore](https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore/new) instead. If you aren't sure where to open it, open the issue here and we will move it if necessary.
