Thanks for filing a Feature request.
If you want to have something added to the gui, you are at the correct place!
But if you want to have something added to the base functionality (for example, add support for new cheats), please open an issue on https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore instead.
# Remove everything above before opening the issue
